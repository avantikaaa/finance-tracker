## Running the pipeline:
1. Add your docker hub credentials to your Jenkins credential manager with the ID "docker_credentials".
2. Update absolute path in the ansible playbook to point to the location where you will run the docker-compose file.
3. Update the absolute path of the volume in the docker compose file to point to the location where you want to store the database.
4. Trigger a build, either manually or through webhooks. This pulls 3 docker images for the frontend(client), backend(server) and the database(mongodb) respectively and starts their containers in the background.
5. Visit: http://localhost:3000/ to use the application
